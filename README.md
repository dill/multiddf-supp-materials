# Supplementary materials for the paper "Extending density surface models to include multiple and double-observer survey data"

This repository contains the data and code to run the two examples from the paper. The examples are provided as `Rmarkdown` files (`.Rmd` in each directory) with various auxiliary files, which have their use explained in the `.Rmd`. PDFs are provided for ease of reading.


## `fin_whales`: aerial and shipboard surveys of fin whale data with corrections for g(0) and availability

Re-analysis of the data presented in [Sigourney et al (2020)](https://peerj.com/articles/8226/):

Sigourney DB, Chavez-Rosales S, Conn PB, Garrison L, Josephson E, Palka D. 2020. Developing and assessing a density surface model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework with a focus on uncertainty: insights from simulations and an application to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) PeerJ 8:e8226 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8226

The survey that the fin whale data originate from was funded through two inter-agency agreements with the National Marine Fisheries Service: inter-agency agreement number M14PG00005 with the US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program, Washington, DC and inter-agency agreement number NEC-16-011-01-FY18 with the US Navy.

Raw data conversion and wrangling code is available in [this `git` repository](https://github.com/densitymodelling/nefsc_fin_mrds_dsm).


## `fulmars`: shipboard survey using the Eastern Canada Seabirds At Sea protocol

Full analysis of these data have been submitted as:

Wakefield, E. D., Miller, D.L., Bond, S.L., Carvalho, P.C., Catry, P., Dilley, B.J., Fifield, D.A., Gjerdrum, C., González-Solís, J., Hogan, H., Laptikhovsky, V., Miller, J.A.O., Miller, P.I., Pinder, S.J., Pipa, T., Thompson, L.A., Thompson, P.M., Matthiopoulos, J. (submitted). "The distribution, habitat associations and abundance of seabirds in the sub-polar frontal zone of the Northwest Atlantic." Progress in Oceanography.

The survey that the fulmar data originate from was funded by the UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) grant NE/M017990/1.
